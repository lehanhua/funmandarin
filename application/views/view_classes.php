				<h3 id="enrichment">Mandarin Enrichment Program <small>for schools without Mandarin Programs</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Our Mandarin Enrichment program can be offered at your school during the school hours or after school. We recommend students to take two, one hour-sessions per week, 
					or a minimum of one hour session a week. Classes should have a minimum of 6 students but no more than 12 students per group to ensure success. Each group will be divided into levels of ability.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Fun Mandarin has created motivational techniques for children to learn Mandarin while having fun with interactive activities such as games, songs, body movement, and stories etc. We also emphasize repetition to achieve correct pronunciation. 
					The students will have the chance to interact with their peers to practice communicating in their new language.<br /><br />
					*We advise a one year program so that the child will realize success in learning a new language.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3 id="pinyin">Fun with Hanyu Pinyin <small>young children's Saturday Class yr 5-8</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Pinyin, more formally Hanyu Pinyin, is the Standard Mandarin romanization system used in Mainland China for teaching school children to read, and it is widely used in teaching materials designed for Westerners who wish to learn Mandarin.
					<br /><br />
Through out the classes, children will learn the correct pinyin (sound) and tone system through songs, games, stories, body movement, and other hands-on activities.  They will recognize more Chinese characters with pinyin system and be able to read and pronounce Chinese the proper way by themselves at the end of the class session.</p>
