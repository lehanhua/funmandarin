				<h3>Young Children's Beginning Mandarin Class <small>play group for young children yr 3-5</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">This is an introductory class for children who are under the age of five with little or no foundation in Mandarin Chinese.

Students will learn Mandarin through songs, rhymes, finger plays, arts & crafts, body movements, stories, and games.
Our lesson begins with basic concepts of numbers, colors, shapes, daily vocabulary, and simple greetings.

Overall themes include telling time, body parts, animals, plants, family members, seasons, holidays, weather, weeks & months, foods, occupations, and so on.</p>

				<h3>Chinese Lessons <small>for school age children yr 5-12</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Children will be immersed in a totally play-based Chinese environment. They will learn to write simple traditional Chinese characters and recognize words and sentences at the beginning level, then gradually practice Chinese speaking and listening skills with teachers and friends.

Children will learn Chinese songs, finger play, games, traditional arts & crafts, ancient poems, and be introduced to some popular children’s literature and folk tales.

Our curriculum is based on “My First Chinese Words” along with many hands-on activities designed by our experienced teachers. Our curriculum is tailored with age-appropriate developmental levels in mind.

This class will cover listening, speaking, writing, and reading skills.</p>

				<h3>Semi-private and Private Lessons</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">
					<strong>private classes</strong><br />
					We work with your schedule and you will learn at your speed and at the place you prefer (home, coffee shop, or office). You can learn faster 
					and re-schedule your classes.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>semi-private classes</strong><br />
						Based on two or three students (maximum of six) at a mutually-convenient place (coffee shop or office).
						You find a friend or we will provide someone at your level to maximize learning. This course is an 10 week session (one hour class).
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>Mandarin Enrichment Program <small>for schools without Mandarin Programs</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Our Mandarin Enrichment program can be offered at your school during the school hours or after school. We recommend students to take two, one hour-sessions per week, 
					or a minimum of one hour session a week. Classes should have a minimum of 6 students but no more than 12 students per group to ensure success. Each group will be divided into levels of ability.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Fun Mandarin has created motivational techniques for children to learn Mandarin while having fun with interactive activities such as games, songs, body movement, and stories etc. We also emphasize repetition to achieve correct pronunciation. 
					The students will have the chance to interact with their peers to practice communicating in their new language.<br /><br />
					*We advise a one year program so that the child will realize success in learning a new language.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>Fun with Hanyu Pinyin <small>young children's Saturday Class yr 5-8</small></h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Pinyin, more formally Hanyu Pinyin, is the Standard Mandarin romanization system used in Mainland China for teaching school children to read, and it is widely used in teaching materials designed for Westerners who wish to learn Mandarin.
					<br /><br />
Through out the classes, children will learn the correct pinyin (sound) and tone system through songs, games, stories, body movement, and other hands-on activities.  They will recognize more Chinese characters with pinyin system and be able to read and pronounce Chinese the proper way by themselves at the end of the class session.</p>
